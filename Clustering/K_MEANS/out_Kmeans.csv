The e-learning portal of the Swachh Bharat Mission features in-depth documentaries focusing on various leading practices in sanitation. The series on Municipal Solid Waste Management has a chapter on Biomethanation and Composting technologies which are being used at various bulk generators for the management of wet waste. The documentary features efforts at IIT Gandhinagar, along with the Art of Living International Center and the Vijay Nagar Society. 
On the IIT Gandhinagar campus, waste segregation is practiced in both the residential and the academic areas. Apart from biomedical or lab waste, everything else is typically classified as organic, recyclable or meant for the landfills. Color-coded dustbins and posters with detailed examples help users identify the right disposal option. As you can see in the video, our in-house biogas plant generates energy and manure from the organic waste. Combined with recycling and other measures, our campus presently diverts about 85% of the waste from the landfills.

Cisco is empowering research on online analytics for complex systems at IIT Gandhinagar through a generous research grant. Professor Anirban Dasgupta from the Computer Science and Engineering discipline at IIT Gandhinagar is the principal investigator of this grant. The support from CISCO amounts to 75,000 USD and the project will be executed over a period of two years. 

According to Professor Dasgupta, ""With the proliferation of sensors, it is now fairly common to use data collected from such sensors in order to track the health of complex engineered systems that are pervasive in various domains. Examples of such systems are large datacenters that utilize thousands of machines, automated manufacturing, nuclear plants, as well as complex ad-serving software e.g. the ones used at Google and Microsoft. However, in order to truly understand the health of the system, and to figure out whether the current behavior of the system is bordering on anomaly, it is essential to take a global view of the data rather than look at individual sensors. Understanding the interaction of the different sensors using statistical models can lead to improvements in diverse problems of immense practical significance, e.g. preventing cascading failures by triggering appropriate safeguards. Such decisions also need to be taken in real-time.""

 The ongoing research supported by CISCO aims to develop techniques for such decision-making, which involves borrowing techniques from streaming algorithms, as well as statistical machine learning models. #iitgnfacultyachievements #iitgnfaculty #NeverBetter",57,"IIT Gandhinagar family congratulates Professor Arup Chakraborty for receiving a grant from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) for the project entitled, ""Real-time concentration measurement of methane, water vapour, carbon dioxide and carbonmonoxide in ethanol autothermal reforming using tunable diode laser spectroscopy"".",93,nan,2

The finishing touches to a campus often comes from the landscape. However, landscape is also the slowest to mature. Our ancestors planted trees and nurtured them for years to give shade and also to protect from harsh weather conditions.

Water is a treasured resource, especially when many parts of the country are going through drought. It was therefore thought of by campus development teams to have a full-scale Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) that would treat the waste water generated on campus and recycle most (if not all) of it. The master-planners of IIT Gandhinagar went one step ahead and proposed that given our landscape and opportunities, developing a natural STP made more sense than investing in an expensive, energy intensive and less environment-friendly treatment plant based on chemical treatment. A three-stage STP wherein the first two stages are completely natural stages and the third stage is a filtration stage that involves no chemicals, was proposed and built. The idea was that this recycled water will be used in all the flushes and all the gardening operations. With the additional infrastructure and equipment finally installed and the additional parallel set of water lines for carrying recycled water operational, we are now getting recycled water in all the flushes and horticulture system across the Palaj campus.",160,nan,1

Started in 2008, IIT Gandhinagar provides a unique opportunity to build a centre of excellence in research, teaching, and community engagement. The institute has already graduated three batch of students who have done exceedingly well. One of the critical pillars of IITGN is its highly accomplished faculty that the Institute has very successfully recruited. IITGN’s five-week immersion foundation program, which focuses on creativity, ethics, social engagement, physical fitness, leadership skills, seeks to tackle some of the central weaknesses of incoming students. To promote critical thinking and an appreciation of the interdisciplinary character of knowledge, undergraduates (and MTech students) take almost 20% of the courses in the humanities and the social sciences. The Institute places great emphasis on globalization and diversity: nearly a third of IIT Gandhinagar’s undergraduates receive study abroad experiences and almost 15 percent of its faculty every semester is visiting faculty, both from India and abroad. The Institute has eliminated departmental silos and developed distinctive centers and programs such as Archeological Sciences, Cognitive Sciences, Safety, and Society and Culture. A number of community outreach programmes at IITGN, including Nyasa for welfare of construction workers, have been well appreciated and recognized. The talk will highlight the innovations in curriculum and governance implemented at IITGN, and will also touch upon some of the challenges ahead.

The story of Narmada water at IIT Gandhinagar begins several years ago, when IITGN was successfully able to negotiate with GWSSB (Gujarat Water Service and Sewerage Board) to lay a new pipeline from the main Narmada canal pipeline to our campus. Imagine a new pipeline just for our campus from Gandhinagar city!

It turns out that Narmada water has low TDS and is potable. This was great news, considering RO systems are unfriendly to the environment (for every litre of water you drink out of an RO system, approximately two litres of water is wasted in the back end).

However, the Narmada water pipeline was delayed for several months, with various hurdles including some land disputes and contractor issues. The construction team bravely implemented a backup plan involving the tube wells on campus, and judiciously installing only a minimum number of ROs. 

We now have Narmada water on campus and a state of the art water treatment facility.

Date: April 1 
Time: 3 pm Venue: A1/002
Abstract:  Nepal was affected by a devastating earthquake of magnitude 7.8 per Richter scale with the epicenter at Gorkha District in a remote hilly area of the country. The earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks caused more than 8,700 fatalities and damage or collapse of more than 600,000 buildings, including UNESCO World Heritage sites in Kathmandu Valley. The earthquake had a significant impact on housing, institutional facilities, heritage buildings, schools, hospitals, and lifelines. Most deaths were due to collapse of vulnerable unreinforced masonry dwellings (mostly adobe and stone masonry). Significant damage and collapse observed in some urban reinforced concrete buildings revealed the negative effect of building irregularities and inadequate design and construction practices. In general, school buildings were worst hit in the earthquake affected area, however there were examples of retrofitted school buildings that performed very well. The speakers will provide an overview of the earthquake and its effects, damage patterns in masonry and reinforced concrete buildings, including housing, schools, and heritage buildings.

With the JEE Advanced results round the corner, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) is hosting an Open House on June 21 and 22 for JEE Advance qualified students from across the country to give them an understanding of different engineering branches, career opportunities, and educational innovations and special facilities at IITGN.
 
The Open House was introduced in 2013 as a single day event. This year the event will be held over two days and will provide overnight accommodation to the participants coming from outside the city on a first-come-first-serve basis. JEE Advanced results are scheduled to be declared on June 19.
 
IITGN Director Prof Sudhir K Jain said, “Many students have doubts about the different disciplines at IITs and which ones to choose. They usually have lots of confusion, misconceptions and queries about things such as safety, accommodation, extracurricular activities, opportunities and so on. The Open House aims to clear such doubts and enable prospective students to take informed decisions.”
 
During the Open House the students will get a chance to know learn about numerous opportunities, academic practices, innovations in engineering education, etc. The event will also highlight IITGN’s unique curriculum, vision, mission, features, student and its 400-acre permanent campus on the banks of the Sabarmati River, to which the Institute will move at the end of this year. IITGN's undergraduate program with a focus on project oriented learning, emphasis on the humanities and the social sciences, and five-week immersion Foundation Programme for incoming students was awarded the 2013 World Education Summit award for innovations in higher education. Another distinctive characteristic of the IITGN programme is a focus on internationalization and more than a third of its undergraduate students receive study abroad opportunities during their tenure at the Institute. 
 
IITGN faculty from different disciplines will hold discussions with prospective students, who will also have an opportunity to interact with current students during the event.
 
An IITGN alumnus of the 2008-2012 batch, Keshav GK said, “After qualifying in IIT-JEE, I didn’t get an opportunity to interact with any IIT faculty for guidance on the choices of engineering branches and related career opportunities and so on. Such an experience would have been extremely helpful for me. The initiative by IITGN to counsel the students is a thoughtful and generous move.”

These pictures are from the experiments conducted as part of the Earthquake Engineering course. The experiments helped understand the effect of three different performance-control strategies on the response of a structural model subjected to ground shaking. Each of the three control strategies are commonly used across the world to protect the buildings, bridges and other structures from the vibrations due to earthquakes and winds. Very sophisticated devices are deployed for a regular structure. The students, however, came up with quite innovative alternatives for rather small structural models.

Three teams performed the experiments. Each team tested a base structure, and the same structure equipped with a tool for structural control. The three tools considered for the structural control were: 1) friction damper (by making steel plates rub against each other), 2) tuned mass damper (by attaching a pendulum on the top), and 3) base isolation (by resting the structure on top of toy cars and connecting the isolated structure to the ground through rubber bands). Each structure was subjected to a series of sinusoidal base shaking, and a white-noise input at the base.
